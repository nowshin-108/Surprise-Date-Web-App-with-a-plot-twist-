# Surprise Date Web App (with a plot twist)

This web app was created as a surprise for my boyfriend on his birthday. I wanted to do something special and unique to ask him on a date, and this app was the perfect solution. It was a fun and creative way to show my love and appreciation for him. Built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app presents the user with the options to say "yes" or "no" to the date invitation.

## How it works

When the user clicks "yes", they are greeted with an alert saying "YAY, I love you." However, there's a twist - the "no" button is programmed to move around the screen, making it impossible for the user to click it!

## Technologies used
